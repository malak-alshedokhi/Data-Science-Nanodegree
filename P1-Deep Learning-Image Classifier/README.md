# Image Classifier 

### This project consists of 2 parts:
- Part one: I have worked through a Jupyter notebook to implement an image classifier with PyTorch.I have built and trained a deep neural network on flower dataset.
- Part two: buiding a command line application for the classifier. My application is a pair of Python scripts that run from the command line; train.py and predict.py.
